<p>I have been working in my pyjamas since more than two years ago. I  mean by this that I have been working remotely from home. Now you may be  thinking, I could never do that, and yeah, you are right, this kind of  job is not made for everyone. It’s got its advantages, but it’s got its  disadvantages as well like everything else in the world. If you don’t  organize yourself thoroughly, you will never be able to put up with it  for a long time. I must to admit that I sometimes miss working in an  office with my colleagues, but in the other hand I’m absolutely aware of  the great advantages that my current job offers me. I think the right  thing to do is try to find a good balance among work and free time. Here  you have some tips to help you find that balance.<!-- more --></p>
<h2>1. Don’t work and spend your free time in the same place</h2>
<p>This is one of the hardest facts for anyone working remotely to  stand. It’s very frustrating (and unhealthy?) to sleep, work, eat, have a  shower, watch TV, … in only one room. I know sometimes you have no  choice since I also had to do all my life within four walls whilst I was  living in San Francisco. Having a bed at a few meters from you when you  are working on something boring is very tempting. Believe me, your  productivity could fall off by far. So as long you can avoid doing this.  Try to set up an independent workspace free of distractions.</p>
<h2>2. Make people who are living with you realize that you are working</h2>
<p>In case you are not living on your own, some people will find hard to  realize that you are really working, not spending all day at home. They  will tend to talk to you or ask you to do things whilst you are  working. Let them know when you knock off.</p>
<h2>3. Make a good use of the free time that a telecommute job offers you</h2>
<p>One of the best advantages of working from home is the large amount  of time that you can save in a day. I have realized that I can have up  to 2 hours of free time more than when I was working in an office  (trains, traffic stucks, lunch times, …). I normally spend that time on  housework (laundry, house cleaning, grocery shopping, cooking, …) and on  chilling me out.</p>
<h2>4. Have a work timetable and carry it out strictly</h2>
<p>Despite some companies already sets you a work timetable, normally  they will give you the freedom of work whenever you want within  reasonable limits. So this is when you have to discipline yourself and  stick to working hours. You can also try to fit your timetable around  people living with you, therefore you will avoid becoming very  unsociable. Don’t get up too early or too late, design timetable which  you can feel comfortable with.</p>
<h2>5. Try to be available as much as you can</h2>
<p>This is a very important point to have in mind when you are a telecommute worker: <strong>availability</strong>.  Try to be available for your company as much as you can, at least  during working hours. There are loads of ways you can be contacted by:  phone, mail, IM, VoIP, … It’s very frustrating when you need a guy who  you are paying for and you can’t find him/her.</p>

<p>This is a very short post, but it might be useful for someone with the same problem. I was trying to install <strong>fcron</strong> on a remote machine via an automated script, but apt-get install couldn’t finish because a dialog using <em>whiptail</em> came up. It wasn’t the common prompt asking yes or no, which can be ignored by the -y option.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there’s a smart workaround to get rid of these prompts:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -q -y fcron</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically we set the type of user interface used for the installer to <em>noninteractive</em> mode before installing the package. You can always reset <em>DEBIAN_FRONTEND</em> to its default value.</p>

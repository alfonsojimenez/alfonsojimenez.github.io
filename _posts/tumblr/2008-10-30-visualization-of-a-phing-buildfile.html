<p><strong>Raphael Stolt</strong> published a method to get a <strong>visualization of a Phing buildfile</strong> a few days ago:</p>
<p><em>Out of the box the Phing -l option can be used to get a first overview of all available targets in a given buildfile but it doesnâ€™t untangle the target dependencies and sometimes a picture is still worth a thousand words. Luckily the Ant community already provides several tools to accomplish the visualization of Ant buildfiles, reaching from solutions that apply a Xslt stylesheet upon a given buildfile.</em></p>
<p>He uses the <em>ant2dot</em> tool and the <em>Graphiz</em> library to show the XML from a buildfile into a graphic. The image represents the flow of the build.<img src="http://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9gjmv5v7C1r0bq3n.png"/></p>

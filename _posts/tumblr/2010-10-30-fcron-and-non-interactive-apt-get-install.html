<div class="text">
<p>This is a very short post, but it might be useful for someone with the same problem. I was trying to install <strong>fcron</strong> on a remote machine via an automated script, but apt-get install couldn’t finish because a dialog using <em>whiptail</em> came up. It wasn’t the common prompt asking yes or no, which can be ignored by the -y option.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there’s a smart workaround to get rid of these prompts:</p>
<div class="codecolorer-container php blackboard">
<div class="php codecolorer"><em>DEBIAN_FRONTEND<span class="sy0">=</span>noninteractive apt<span class="sy0">-</span>get install <span class="sy0">-</span>q <span class="sy0">-</span>y fcron</em></div>
</div>
<p>Basically we set the type of user interface used for the installer to <em>noninteractive</em> mode before installing the package. You can always reset <em>DEBIAN_FRONTEND</em> to its default value.</p>
</div>
